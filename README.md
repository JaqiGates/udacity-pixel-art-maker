# Udacity Pixel Art Maker
This project was submitted to Udacity during their Intro to Programming Nanodegree course. It is a pixel art maker web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A user can choose the size of their canvas and then apply any color they choose to the canvas by simply clicking on the square they want to change. The canvas can be cleared again by clicking the Submit button, which creates a new canvas.

## Project Instructions
The goal of this project was to build upon starter HTML and CSS code by using JavaScript to create an interactive web app.

We were instructed to:
- Use the DOM and variables to store the values of the colors and canvas size chosen by the user.
- Add event listeners so the user can change the colors and canvas size.
- Use a `makeGrid()` function containing loops to create and clear the canvas when called.
- When the pixel art maker is complete the user should be able to create a canvas of any size, choose a color with the color picker, and click on the canvas squares to change their colors.
